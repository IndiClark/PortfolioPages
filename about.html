            <p>Hi, I'm Indi Clark, a passionate educator and developer. I began my journey in Instructional Design after realizing that to get the best of a student, it is the teacher's job to ensure that my teaching style matches their learning methods. I hope to develop learning programs to educate teachers and inspire children to surpass their wildest dreams!</p>
